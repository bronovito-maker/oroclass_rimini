## 💎 Project Overview

This project is a total re-imagining of **OroClass Rimini**, a historic gold buying business. The goal was to transform a standard "Compro Oro" website into a **Financial Boutique Experience**. 

We moved away from the typical "noisy" and "urgent" aesthetic of the sector, embracing a **Dark Luxury** mood that communicates authority, tranquility, and high value. The core philosophy is **Human-Centric Fintech**: blending digital efficiency (live calculator) with human warmth (the "Sabrina" trust factor).

### 🎯 Core Objectives
*   **Trust First**: Dismantle the stigma of gold selling through transparency and social proof.
*   **Mobile Speed**: Designed primarily for the smartphone user on the go.
*   **Zero Friction**: From landing to "Call Now" in less than 3 seconds.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌑 Dark Luxury UI
A proprietary design system built on deep blacks (`#0B0E14`), charcoal grays, and a warm metallic gold (`#E1C16E`). Glassmorphism effects (`backdrop-filter`) are used in the navigation and overlays to create depth and sophistication.

### 2. 🧮 Live Gold Calculator (Conversion Engine)
A custom-built JavaScript widget that floats over the hero section.
*   **Precision Input**: Replaced inexact sliders with large numeric fields.
*   **Rolling Numbers**: Total value animates smoothly (`CountUp` effect) for a premium feel.
*   **WhatsApp Lock**: The "Lock Price" button pre-fills a message to the store manager.

### 3. 🤝 Human-Centric Trust Engine
*   **Reviews**: Strategic placement of verified testimonials ("Wall of Love") immediately after price discovery.
*   **The "Sabrina" Factor**: A dedicated section introducing the Store Manager to humanize the business ("No bulletproof glass").

### 4. 📱 Sticky Mobile CTA
A persistent bottom bar on mobile devices containing the two most critical actions:
*   📞 **Chiama Subito** (Call Now)
*   📍 **Naviga** (Google Maps)

### 5. ⚖️ Legal Compliance
Full integration of regulatory requirements for the Gold Buying sector:
*   **OAM Registration**: `OCO4209` visible in footer.
*   **Police Authorization**: Questura License data included.
*   **Anti-Money Laundering**: Dedicated legal section explaining ID requirements and cash limits (> €499.99).
