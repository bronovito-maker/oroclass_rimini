# OroClass Rimini - Premium Fintech Gold Buyer Platform

## 💎 Project Overview
This project represents a complete redesign of the **OroClass Rimini** digital presence. The goal was to transform a traditional "Compro Oro" website into a **Human-Centric Luxury Fintech Platform**.

By blending the warmth of personal service ("The Sabrina Effect") with the precision of financial tools, the new site establishes **OroClass** as the "Gold Standard" in Rimini.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Human-Centric Luxury Design
- **Aesthetic**: A sophisticated **Onyx (#0B0E14)** and **Warm Gold (#E1C16E)** color palette that conveys authority without being cold.
- **Typography**: Uses *Montserrat* for commanding headers and *Inter* for clean, readable body text.
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern UI elements with frosted glass effects for depth and elegance.

### 2. "Transparency Engine" Calculator
- **No Hidden Fees**: A custom calculator that breaks down the math for the user:
  `Spot Price` × `Purity` - `Spread` = **Your Payout**.
- **Real-Time Data**: Designed to work with live market feed inputs.
- **Conversion Focus**: "Lock Price" (Blocca Prezzo) call-to-action to drive in-store visits.

### 3. Fintech Trust Signals
- **Live Ticker**: A stock-market style ticker showing real-time Gold and Silver trends.
- **Wall of Love**: A prominent testimonials section featuring specific, high-trust reviews (Lucia, Filippo, Leonardo).
- **Compliance Grid**: Clear visualization of OAM licensing, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and European Accessibility standards.

### 4. Mobile-First Optimization
- **Sticky Action Bar**: A floating bottom bar on mobile ensures critical actions ("Call", "Map") are always within thumb's reach.
- **Performance**: Optimized CSS/JS for 60fps animations and instant load times.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Properties/Variables), Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Build Tool**: Vite (for fast development and bundled production builds).
- **Styling**: BEM naming convention, fully responsive Grid/Flexbox layouts.
